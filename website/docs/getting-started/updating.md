# Updating & Uninstalling

## Updating

### Git installs

Update to the latest version with a single command:

```bash
council update
```

This pulls the latest code from `main`, updates dependencies, and prompts you to configure any new options that were added since your last update.

### pip installs

PyPI releases track **tagged versions** (major and minor releases), not every commit on `main`. Check for updates and upgrade with:

```bash
council update --check    # see if a newer release is on PyPI
council update            # runs pip install --upgrade ai-council
```

Or manually:

```bash
pip install --upgrade ai-council    # or: uv pip install --upgrade ai-council
```

:::tip
`council update` automatically detects new configuration options and prompts you to add them. If you skipped that prompt, you can manually run `council config check` to see missing options, then `council config migrate` to interactively add them.
:::

### What happens during an update (git installs)

When you run `council update`, the following steps occur:

1. **Pairing-data snapshot** — a lightweight pre-update state snapshot is saved (covers `~/.council/pairing/`, Feishu comment rules, and other state files that get modified at runtime). Recoverable via the snapshot restore flow described under [Snapshots and rollback](../user-guide/checkpoints-and-rollback.md), or by extracting the most recent quick-snapshot zip Council wrote next to your `~/.council/` directory.
2. **Git pull** — pulls the latest code from the `main` branch and updates submodules
3. **Post-pull syntax validation + auto-rollback** — after the pull, Council compiles the eight critical files every `council` invocation imports at startup. If any fails to parse (e.g. an orphan merge-conflict marker, an accidentally truncated file), Council runs `git reset --hard <pre-pull-sha>` to roll the install back so your shell stays bootable. Re-run `council update` once the upstream fix lands.
4. **Dependency install** — runs `uv pip install -e ".[all]"` to pick up new or changed dependencies
5. **Config migration** — detects new config options added since your version and prompts you to set them
6. **Gateway auto-restart** — running gateways are refreshed after the update completes so the new code takes effect immediately. Service-managed gateways (systemd on Linux, launchd on macOS) are restarted through the service manager. Manual gateways are relaunched automatically when Council can map the running PID back to a profile.

### Updating against a non-default branch: `--branch`

By default `council update` tracks `origin/main`. Pass `--branch <name>` to update against a different branch — useful for QA channels, feature branches, or release-candidate testing:

```bash
council update --branch release-candidate
council update --check --branch experimental   # preview behindness only
```

If your local checkout is on a different branch, Council auto-stashes any uncommitted work, switches HEAD to the target branch, and then pulls. Branches that don't exist locally are auto-tracked from `origin/<name>` (`git checkout -B <name> origin/<name>`). Branches that don't exist anywhere fail cleanly — your stashed changes are restored before exit so you're never stranded in a weird state. The `main`-only fork-upstream sync logic is automatically skipped on non-`main` branches.

### Preview-only: `council update --check`

Want to know if an update is available before pulling? Run `council update --check` — for git installs it fetches and compares commits against `origin/main`; for pip installs it queries PyPI for the latest release. No files are modified, no gateway is restarted. Useful in scripts and cron jobs that gate on "is there an update".

### Full pre-update backup: `--backup`

For high-value profiles (production gateways, shared team installs) you can opt into a full pre-pull backup of `COUNCIL_HOME` (config, auth, sessions, skills, pairing):

```bash
council update --backup
```

Or make it the default for every run:

```yaml
# ~/.council/config.yaml
updates:
  pre_update_backup: true
```

`--backup` was the always-on behavior in earlier builds, but it was adding minutes to every update on large homes, so it's now opt-in. The lightweight pairing-data snapshot above still runs unconditionally.

### Windows: another `council.exe` is running

On Windows, `council update` will refuse to run if it detects another `council.exe` process holding the venv's entry-point executable open — most commonly the Council Desktop app's spawned backend, an open `council` REPL in another terminal, or a running gateway:

```
$ council update
✗ Another council.exe is running:
    PID 12345  council.exe

  Updating now would fail to overwrite ...\venv\Scripts\council.exe because
  Windows blocks REPLACE on a running executable.

  Close Council Desktop, exit any open `council` REPLs, and
  stop the gateway (`council gateway stop`) before retrying.
  Override with `council update --force` if you've already
  confirmed those processes will not write to the venv.
```

Close the listed processes and re-run. If you're sure the concurrent process won't interfere (rare — usually only useful when an antivirus shim is mis-attributed), pass `--force` to skip the check. In that case the updater will still retry the `.exe` rename with exponential backoff and, on stubborn locks, schedule the replacement for next reboot via `MoveFileEx(MOVEFILE_DELAY_UNTIL_REBOOT)` so the update can complete.

Expected output looks like:

```
$ council update
Updating Poke Council...
📥 Pulling latest code...
Already up to date.  (or: Updating abc1234..def5678)
📦 Updating dependencies...
✅ Dependencies updated
🔍 Checking for new config options...
✅ Config is up to date  (or: Found 2 new options — running migration...)
🔄 Restarting gateways...
✅ Gateway restarted
✅ Poke Council updated successfully!
```

### Recommended Post-Update Validation

`council update` handles the main update path, but a quick validation confirms everything landed cleanly:

1. `git status --short` — if the tree is unexpectedly dirty, inspect before continuing
2. `council doctor` — checks config, dependencies, and service health
3. `council --version` — confirm the version bumped as expected
4. If you use the gateway: `council gateway status`
5. If `doctor` reports npm audit issues: run `npm audit fix` in the flagged directory

:::warning Dirty working tree after update
If `git status --short` shows unexpected changes after `council update`, stop and inspect them before continuing. This usually means local modifications were reapplied on top of the updated code, or a dependency step refreshed lockfiles.
:::

### If your terminal disconnects mid-update

`council update` protects itself against accidental terminal loss:

- The update ignores `SIGHUP`, so closing your SSH session or terminal window no longer kills it mid-install. `pip` and `git` child processes inherit this protection, so the Python environment cannot be left half-installed by a dropped connection.
- All output is mirrored to `~/.council/logs/update.log` while the update runs. If your terminal disappears, reconnect and inspect the log to see whether the update finished and whether the gateway restart succeeded:

```bash
tail -f ~/.council/logs/update.log
```

- `Ctrl-C` (SIGINT) and system shutdown (SIGTERM) are still honored — those are deliberate cancellations, not accidents.

You no longer need to wrap `council update` in `screen` or `tmux` to survive a terminal drop.

### Checking your current version

```bash
council version
```

Compare against the latest release at the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/pokelabshq/council/releases).

### Updating from Messaging Platforms

You can also update directly from Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, or Teams by sending:

```
/update
```

This pulls the latest code, updates dependencies, and restarts running gateways. The bot will briefly go offline during the restart (typically 5–15 seconds) and then resume.

### Manual Update

If you installed manually (not via the quick installer):

```bash
cd /path/to/ai-council
export VIRTUAL_ENV="$(pwd)/venv"

# Pull latest code
git pull origin main

# Reinstall (picks up new dependencies)
uv pip install -e ".[all]"

# Check for new config options
council config check
council config migrate   # Interactively add any missing options
```

### Rollback instructions

If an update introduces a problem, you can roll back to a previous version:

```bash
cd /path/to/ai-council

# List recent versions
git log --oneline -10

# Roll back to a specific commit
git checkout <commit-hash>
git submodule update --init --recursive
uv pip install -e ".[all]"

# Restart the gateway if running
council gateway restart
```

To roll back to a specific release tag (substitute your previous tag — e.g. a recent release like `v2026.5.16`, or any earlier tag from `git tag --sort=-version:refname`):

```bash
git checkout vX.Y.Z
git submodule update --init --recursive
uv pip install -e ".[all]"
```

:::warning
Rolling back may cause config incompatibilities if new options were added. Run `council config check` after rolling back and remove any unrecognized options from `config.yaml` if you encounter errors.

### Note for Nix users

If you installed via Nix flake, updates are managed through the Nix package manager:

```bash
# Update the flake input
nix flake update ai-council

# Or rebuild with the latest
nix profile upgrade ai-council
```

Nix installations are immutable — rollback is handled by Nix's generation system:

```bash
nix profile rollback
```

See [Nix Setup](./nix-setup.md) for more details.

## Uninstalling

### Git installs

```bash
council uninstall
```

The uninstaller gives you the option to keep your configuration files (`~/.council/`) for a future reinstall.

### pip installs

```bash
pip uninstall ai-council
rm -rf ~/.council            # Optional — keep if you plan to reinstall
```

### Manual Uninstall

```bash
rm -f ~/.local/bin/council
rm -rf /path/to/ai-council
rm -rf ~/.council            # Optional — keep if you plan to reinstall
```

:::info
If you installed the gateway as a system service, stop and disable it first:
```bash
council gateway stop
# Linux: systemctl --user disable council-gateway
# macOS: launchctl remove ai.council.gateway
```
